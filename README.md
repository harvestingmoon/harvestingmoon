- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Wen Yeong otherwise known as @harvestingmoon.
  
I am a Business Analytics Student at the National University Of Singapore.

I am a deep learning and computer vision enthusiast. Occasionally, I make telegram bots for fun too. 

Most of my projects are coded in Python with the occasional Java. (But that is because my projects are mostly deep learning ie I use PyTorch alot).
